Smart Home Automation System
Overview
The Smart Home Automation System is a full-stack application designed to control and manage various smart devices (such as lights, air conditioners, and security cameras) from a centralized web interface. The application integrates a React frontend with a Java (Spring Boot) backend, enabling users to perform operations such as turning devices on/off, adjusting settings, and monitoring real-time status.

Key Features
Device Management
Device Control Dashboard: Displays all devices with their current status (e.g., on/off, brightness level, temperature).
Control Panel: Allows users to perform actions like turning devices on/off or adjusting settings.
Categorization: Devices are organized by type (e.g., LightBulb, AirConditioner, SecurityCamera).
Asynchronous Operations: Uses multithreading to simulate real-world asynchronous device behavior.
Frontend Features
React Components: Modular and reusable components for scalability.
Real-Time Updates (Optional): Periodic updates or use of WebSockets for real-time data.
Error Handling: Displays error messages when issues occur with device response or backend connection.
Responsive Design: Ensures usability across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
Backend API
RESTful Services: Provides RESTful APIs to control and monitor devices.
Multithreading: Each device runs on a separate thread for asynchronous operation simulation.
Device State Management: Stores and manages the state of each device (on/off, brightness, temperature, etc.).
Security (Optional): Implements security best practices (e.g., JWT, OAuth2).
User Dashboard
Device Overview: Displays all devices in a list format with status details.
Logs & Activity History: Provides logs of device actions (e.g., turned on/off, settings changes).
Database Integration (Optional)
Persistence: Uses a relational database (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL) to store device states.
Testing
Backend Testing: Unit testing with JUnit and Mockito.
Frontend Testing: Component testing with Jest and React Testing Library (Optional).
